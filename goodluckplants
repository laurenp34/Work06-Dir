Acorns and their bearers, oak trees, bring good fortune according to Norse folklore. The Vikings associated oak trees with Thor, the god who created thunder and lightning with his great anvil and hammer. Because the tree attracted lightning, it was sacred to Thor. The Vikings believed that the fruit of the oak tree, the acorn, was spared Thor's wrath, so Vikings placed a lone acorn on their windowsills to protect their houses from lightning.
Rainbows are mentioned in the Old Testament. God created a rainbow after the flood as a sign that the Earth would never be destroyed by flood again. Irish leprechauns are said to hide their gold at the end of rainbows, although we all know that a rainbow's end is impossible to find!
Eggs are powerful symbols of fertility, purity, and rebirth in traditional folk religion. They are used in magical rituals to promote fertility and restore virility, look into the future, bring good weather, encourage the growth of crops, protect both cattle and children against misfortune, and ward off the "Evil Eye." In England, a gift of a white egg is considered lucky, but a brown egg is unlucky.
